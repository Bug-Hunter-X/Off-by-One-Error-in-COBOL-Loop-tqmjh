This repository contains a simple COBOL program demonstrating a common off-by-one error in loops. The `bug.cob` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cob` provides a corrected version.  The error arises from an incorrect loop termination condition, leading to an unexpected number of iterations.  The solution demonstrates how to correct the condition for accurate loop execution.
